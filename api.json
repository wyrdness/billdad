      "summary": "A kangaroo-like creature allegedly imported from Australia to Wisconsin, capable of jumping incredible distances across the northern forests.",
      "full": "The Billdad is unique among fearsome critters as it has an origin story: supposedly an Australian import brought to Wisconsin lumber camps. This kangaroo-like creature can jump extraordinary distances—far beyond any real kangaroo's capability—bounding across the northern forests in great leaps. According to the tall tales, lumberjacks or entrepreneurs imported Billdads from Australia, thinking they'd be useful for lumber camp work, but the creatures escaped into the Wisconsin wilderness where they continue to make their improbable leaps. The Billdad represents the fearsome critter tradition's occasional attempts at pseudo-plausible origin stories, making the absurd seem slightly more believable by giving it a specific backstory."
